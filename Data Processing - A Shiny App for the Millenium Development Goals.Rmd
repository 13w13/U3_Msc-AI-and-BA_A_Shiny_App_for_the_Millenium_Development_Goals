## 1. Introduction


### 1.1 Aim of the Group Project from U3-Programming-Advanced R-Msc AI and BA - TBS
- The aim of the project is to make an interactive graphical presentation of data using Shiny App.
- The user should be able to select parameters themselves. The data must be non-trivial, requiring the use of data from several sources or from several different tables.
- Work in groups. circa Three students per group. You can self-select groups.
- There should be need for computations on the data to achive the final results.


### 1.2 Presentaiton of the project choosen and Data
The goal of our project is to build a shiny App to monitor Millennium Developement Goals Progress over time. 

In the year 2000, the member states of the United Nations agreed to a set of goals to measure the progress of global development. The aim of these goals was to increase standards of living around the world by emphasizing human capital, infrastructure, and human rights.     

The eight goals are:

    To eradicate extreme poverty and hunger
    To achieve universal primary education
    To promote gender equality and empower women
    To reduce child mortality
    To improve maternal health
    To combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases
    To ensure environmental sustainability
    To develop a global partnership for development


Data on Millennium Development Goals (MDG) indicator trends for developing countries and for different groups of countries are curated in the World Development Indicators database. Each year the World Bank uses these data to assess the progress made towards the MDGs.    

In order to have an aggreted data, we have used a very rich database provided by **Driven Data** offering an open challenge until 2021 with data compiled from the http://www.worldbank.org/ website. The description below of the MDG below comes from their plateforme. 

Driven Data aggregated  data from 1972-2007 on over 1200 macroeconomic indicators in 214 countries around the world. Each row represents a timeseries for a specific indicator and country. The row has an id, a country name, a series code, a series name, and data for the years 1972 - 2007.   



We hope that this presentation allowed to understand our project and the real usefulness of a shiny app! 
Indeed, building interactive dashboards offers the possibility to explore the evolution trend for each country and/or region of the world, to compare them both for each macroeconomic indicator but also for each millennium goal.

#Example of outline

    Create two Plots: one with death per capita, one with death in absolute numbers. Hint: From coronaD, create a new data table with death per capita instead of death.

    In the original data table coronaD, downloaded from GitHub, add one row with EU27 (the countries in the table that is also a country in the European Union)

    For extra credits: Add annotations to your plot, e.g. the start of the national lock-downs.
    Collect user input:
        Let the user decide between logarithmic and linear scale on the y-axis
        Let the user decide which countries to highlight
        Let the user decide which time frame
    Use a nice theme for the plots, preferably construct the theme yourself with + theme()

    For extra credits: Use a nice theme and layout for the website




## 2. Starting the project

### 2.0 Loading library  
```{r}
library(shiny)
library(magrittr)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(httr)
library(readxl)
library(stringr)
library(XML)
library("methods")
library(dplyr)
```



### 2.1 Loading Files
```{r}
urlfile="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1mbWQtW83faGtfnwnjlopJblGavaCm7_T"
```

We have registerred into the plateform to acces to the databse and updated the csv file in google Drive

```{r}
goalD<-urlfile%>% url %>% read_csv %>% as.data.table 
```


```{r}
goalD %>% head()
str(goalD)
```


```{r}
goalD[X1==559]
```
So here we can see that ID=559 corresponds to Afganistant 7.8 indicators for environetanl sustainibilty goal (Goal7) According to MG website, 7.8 is defined by the Proportion of population using an improved drinking water source. 



Using colnames() in order to extract all the column names that are Dates and save these as the character vector Dates. 
Dates are from the 2dn column to the 37th
But first, we should rename these columns by removing "YR+Date" and add a _ in the other columns

```{r}
cols<-c("Index","1972","1973","1974","1975","1976","1977","1978","1979","1980","1981","1982","1983","1984","1985","1986","1987","1988","1989","1990","1991","1992","1993","1994","1995","1996","1997","1998","1999","2000","2001","2002","2003","2004","2005","2006","2007","Country_Name","Series_Code","Series_Name")
colnames(goalD)<-cols
head(goalD)
```


```{r}
Dates = (colnames(goalD[,!(c(1,38,39,40))]))
```


### 2.2 Building up Goals - Topics and Sub-Topics
Count unique macroindicator by Series Name and Series Code

```{r}
goalD[,.N,(goalD$Series_Name)]
goalD[,.N,(goalD$Series_Code)]
```
There are 1305 unique Series Name and Series Code

Class what are the most frequent macroindicators
```{r}
goalD[,.N,by = list(Series_Code,Series_Name)] %>% .[order(-N)]
```


Get metric in indicators Names : 
Using stringr library and str_extract_all in order to get in a matrix all what is inside parenthesis

```{r}
# Get the parenthesis and what is inside
metrics <- as.data.frame(str_extract_all(goalD$Series_Name, "\\([^()]+\\)", simplify = TRUE))
```

Some metrics had double parenthesis and thus created a second column in our matrix
```{r}
unique(metrics[,2])
```

We should merge them into the first column. So we copy content of second colomun into first if second is not null. 

```{r}
metrics$V1 <- apply(metrics, 1, function(x) paste(str_trim(x[!is.na(x)]), collapse=""))
```

```{r}
metrics %>% head
```


```{r}
#Verify results
metrics$V1[10000]
goalD[10000]
```
We can then add new column to goalD. 

```{r}
goalD$Metrics<-metrics$V1
goalD %>% head
```

We need to add new row with the attached Goal for each indicators in order to have a global view of each indicators. 
To do that, we need to add another ressource to our data : mapping from the World Bank. 
https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/201175-how-does-the-world-bank-code-its-indicators

"A systematic coding convention is an important part of database design. Variable codes should be both convenient to use and easy to remember. Codes that are long and descriptive are slow to enter and result in formulas that are difficult to read."
The data help desk from the World Bank provides Word Developeemnt Indicatorcode breakdowns and descriptions for each component. 

Let us load this code.
```{r}
urlfile_WDI_break="http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/site-content/WDI_CETS.xls"
```

WDI series code are in the 2dn sheet of the xls file. 
We use Get function since readxl doesn't support http download yet.  
```{r}
GET(urlfile_WDI_break, write_disk(tf <- tempfile(fileext = ".xls")))
WDI_break <- read_xls(tf, sheet=2) %>% as.data.table 
head(WDI_break)
WDI_break %>% View
```

Rename Series Code and Series Name with underscore

```{r}
colnames(WDI_break) =  colnames(WDI_break) %>% gsub(" ","_",.) 
```
Count how many series code there is in WDI_break, topics, sub-topics1, sub-topics2 and sub-topic3 and order them by frequency
```{r}
WDI_break[,.N,(WDI_break$Series_Code)]%>% .[order(-N)]
WDI_break[,.N,(WDI_break$Topic)]%>% .[order(-N)]
WDI_break[,.N,(WDI_break$SubTopic1)]%>% .[order(-N)]
WDI_break[,.N,(WDI_break$SubTopic2)]%>% .[order(-N)]
WDI_break[,.N,(WDI_break$SubTopic3)]%>% .[order(-N)]
```

Some Series Code (those in miniscule and numbers are not codded in World Bank Break). We decided to remove them from our dataset By doing an inner join(by setting: allx=FALSE)
```{r}
goalD_old <-goalD
goalD <- merge(goalD,WDI_break, by.x = 'Series_Code', by.y = 'Series_Code', all = FALSE)
```
Count removed observations
```{r}
dim(goalD_old)-dim(goalD)
```
We have removed 13 677 observations due to missing informations in our coding tables. 


We can remove 1 dupicated Series_Name from our dataset
```{r}
goalD<-goalD[,!42]
colnames(goalD[,40])="Series_Name"
```


### 2.3 Contry Classification
Here Country Classifications
https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups


Use current classification of World Bank for country
```{r}
urlfile_Country_break="http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/site-content/CLASS.xls"
```

Here we use sheet n=1 (for funny fact, the excel file had 1 hidden sheet :)) and select group name
```{r}
GET(urlfile_Country_break, write_disk(tf <- tempfile(fileext = ".xls")))
Country_break <- read_xls(tf, range="C5:I224", sheet=1) %>% as.data.table 
head(Country_break)
Country_break %>% View
```
The idea for the final Shiny app is to propose selection of aggregaed Countries following World Bank classification to the user in order to compare indicators in different countries. 


The Column E and the Row 6 from our excel file were empty. We can remove them. 
Furthermore, we can void Code information from our table and remplace space in colname by an inderscore. 

```{r}
#Extract iso code for later map
Code_break<-Country_break[,c(1,2)] %>% setDT
Country_break<-Country_break[!1,!c(2,3)]
colnames(Country_break) =  colnames(Country_break) %>% gsub(" ","_",.) 
Country_break %>% head
```




The World Bank provides details about how they classify countries :
https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/378834-how-does-the-world-bank-classify-countries


From their website, we can read that 
"The main classifications provided are by geographic region, by income group, and by the operational lending categories of the World Bank Group.[...]   
Groupings are primarily based on the regions used for administrative purposes by the World Bank. There are two main variants: one which includes all economies, and one which excludes high-income economies (see income groups below for the definition of low-, lower middle-, upper middle-, and high-income categories).    

Income groups
Economies are currently divided into four income groupings: low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high. Income is measured using gross national income (GNI) per capita, in U.S. dollars, converted from local currency using the World Bank Atlas method.

Economies are divided into IDA, IBRD, and Blend countries based on the operational policies of the World Bank. International Development Association (IDA) countries are those with low per capita incomes that lack the financial ability to borrow from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). Blend countries are eligible for IDA loans but are also eligible for IBRD loans because they are financially creditworthy. 


Finaly, Other country groupings in World Development Indicators include OECD member countries, countries in the euro area, member states of the European Union, the UN Least Development Countries classification, and the World."

We can now perform an Left Join with merge function
```{r}
goalD<-merge(goalD,Country_break, by.x = 'Country_Name', by.y = 'Economy', all.x=TRUE)
goalD %>% head
```

Let's see how France is classify
```{r}
goalD[Country_Name=="France"] %>% head
```





## 2.4 Aggregation View 

### 2.4.1 Create mean of each Region each Year
The input in the for indicator will be an user input


```{r}
mean_region_goalD=goalD[, lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm=TRUE), by=list(Region,Series_Name.x),.SDcols=c("1972","1973","1974","1975","1976","1977","1978","1979","1980","1981","1982","1983","1984","1985","1986","1987","1988","1989","1990","1991","1992","1993","1994","1995","1996","1997","1998","1999","2000","2001","2002","2003","2004","2005","2006","2007") ]
```

Verfiy results : compute the mean in goalD for the 1972 year, Region South Asia for the GDP and compare with the mean_regio_goald value. 
```{r}
sum(goalD[Region=="South Asia"&Series_Name.x=="GDP (current US$)"][,4],na.rm=TRUE)/6
mean_region_goalD[Region=="South Asia"&Series_Name.x=="GDP (current US$)"][,3]
```



### 2.4.2 For mean_income_goalD
```{r}
mean_income_goalD=goalD[, lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm=TRUE), by=list(Income_group,Series_Name.x),.SDcols=c("1972","1973","1974","1975","1976","1977","1978","1979","1980","1981","1982","1983","1984","1985","1986","1987","1988","1989","1990","1991","1992","1993","1994","1995","1996","1997","1998","1999","2000","2001","2002","2003","2004","2005","2006","2007") ]
mean_income_goalD %>% tail
```

Verify results 2 
```{r}

sum(goalD[Income_group=="Low income"&Series_Name.x=="GDP (current US$)"][,4],na.rm=TRUE)/20
mean_income_goalD[Income_group=="Low income"&Series_Name.x=="GDP (current US$)"][,3]

```
We are good ! 
### 2.4.3 For mean_lending_goalD
```{r}
mean_lending_goalD=goalD[, lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm=TRUE), by=list(Lending_category,Series_Name.x),.SDcols=c("1972","1973","1974","1975","1976","1977","1978","1979","1980","1981","1982","1983","1984","1985","1986","1987","1988","1989","1990","1991","1992","1993","1994","1995","1996","1997","1998","1999","2000","2001","2002","2003","2004","2005","2006","2007") ]
mean_lending_goalD %>% head
```

### 2.4.4 For mean_other_goalD
```{r}
mean_other_goalD=goalD[, lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm=TRUE), by=list(Other,Series_Name.x),.SDcols=c("1972","1973","1974","1975","1976","1977","1978","1979","1980","1981","1982","1983","1984","1985","1986","1987","1988","1989","1990","1991","1992","1993","1994","1995","1996","1997","1998","1999","2000","2001","2002","2003","2004","2005","2006","2007") ]
mean_other_goalD %>% head
```

### 2.5 Geo Cod (finaly non used variable but keep steps for document)
Missing Geocoding in world Bank dataset. How to build a map ? 
Using WB API for new data.table

```{r}
res = xmlParse("http://api.worldbank.org/v2/country")
print(res)
rootnode <- xmlRoot(res)
# Exract the root node form the xml file.
print(rootnode[1])

# Get the first element of the first node.
print(rootnode[[1]][[1]])
# Convert into dataframe
goalD_geo<-xmlToDataFrame("http://api.worldbank.org/v2/country") %>% setDT()


#Check for Belgium
goalD_geo[name=="Belgium"]
```

### 2.6 Flags

```{r}
flags <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/13w13/A_Shiny_App_for_the_Millenium_Development_Goals/main/img/Country_flag.csv")
#goalD %>% View
#flags[,1] %>% View

flags %>% head


cols2<-c("Country_Name","Images.File.Name","ImageURL")
colnames(flags)=cols2        
        
PlotDT_Flags <- merge(goalD, flags,by.x = 'Country_Name', by.y = 'Country_Name', all= FALSE)

PlotDT_Flags %>% View
#unique(PlotDT_Flags$Country_Name) %>% View
#unique(PlotDT_Flags$ImageURL) %>% View
```


### 2.7 Add Indicators Metadata and desription for shiny App
World Bank provides complete glossary of its indicator. We seleted our WDI dataset and downloaded the xls file.  https://databank.worldbank.org/metadataglossary/World-Development-Indicators/series#

```{r}
urlfile_WDI_metadata="https://databank.worldbank.org/metadata/glossary_download.aspx?DbID=2&Concept=series&SearchTxt=&DBname=World%20Development%20Indicators"
```

Here we use sheet n=1 (for funny fact, the excel file had 1 hidden sheet :)) and select group name
```{r}
GET(urlfile_WDI_metadata, write_disk(tf <- tempfile(fileext = ".xls")))
WDI_metadata <- read_xls(tf, range="A1:D1438", sheet=2) %>% as.data.table 
head(WDI_metadata)

```


```{r}
melt(goalD)
```

##3 Creating plots
### 3.1 Casting from a wide table to a long table:

3.1.1 For goalD table
```{r}
PlotDT = data.table::melt(goalD, id.vars = c(1,2,3,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49), 
          measure.vars = Dates, 
          variable.name = "Date",
          value.name = "Value")

#PlotDT %>% View()
```



Change the data type of the Date column to "Date" using the function as.Date()
```{r}

PlotDT$Date = PlotDT$Date %>%  as.Date(format = "%Y")
head(PlotDT$Date)

```
as.date needs day and month. Here create fake days and month.

### 3.1.2 For mean_region_goalD


```{r}
PlotDT_Region =  data.table::melt(mean_region_goalD, id.vars = c(1,2), 
          measure.vars = Dates, 
          variable.name = "Date",
          value.name = "Value")
```
Change data type
```{r}
PlotDT_Region$Date = PlotDT_Region$Date%>%  as.Date(format = "%Y")
```


### 3.1.3 For mean_income_goalD

```{r}
PlotDT_Income_group=  data.table::melt(mean_income_goalD, id.vars = c(1,2), 
          measure.vars = Dates, 
          variable.name = "Date",
          value.name = "Value")
```
Change data type
```{r}
PlotDT_Income_group$Date = PlotDT_Income_group$Date%>%  as.Date(format = "%Y")
```
```{r}
PlotDT_Income_group%>% head

```


### 3.1.4 For mean_lending_goalD
```{r}
PlotDT_Lending_category=  data.table::melt(mean_lending_goalD, id.vars = c(1,2), 
          measure.vars = Dates, 
          variable.name = "Date",
          value.name = "Value")
```
Change data type
```{r}
PlotDT_Lending_category$Date = PlotDT_Lending_category$Date%>%  as.Date(format = "%Y")
```
### 3.1.4 For mean_other_goalD
```{r}
PlotDT_Other=  data.table::melt(mean_other_goalD, id.vars = c(1,2), 
          measure.vars = Dates, 
          variable.name = "Date",
          value.name = "Value")
```
Change data type
```{r}
PlotDT_Other$Date = PlotDT_Other$Date%>%  as.Date(format = "%Y")
```



###3.2 Create basic Plot


```{r}
ggplot() +
      geom_line(data=PlotDT[`Country_Name`=="Afghanistan" &`Series_Name.x`=="GDP (current US$)"], aes(x=Date, y=Value,colour=" Selected Country"))+ geom_line(data=PlotDT_Region[`Series_Name.x`=="GDP (current US$)"], aes(x= Date, y = Value,colour = `Region`))

```


#Test other from income group
```{r}
ggplot() +
      geom_line(data=PlotDT[`Country_Name`=="China" &`Series_Name.x`=="GDP (current US$)"], aes(x=Date, y=Value,colour=" Selected Country"))+ geom_line(data=PlotDT_Income_group[`Series_Name.x`=="GDP (current US$)"], aes(x= Date, y = Value,colour = `Income_group`))
```


```{r}
ggplot() +
      geom_line(data=PlotDT[`Country_Name`=="China" &`Series_Name.x`=="GDP (current US$)"], aes(x=Date, y=Value,colour=" Selected Country"))+ geom_line(data=PlotDT_Income_group[`Series_Name.x`=="GDP (current US$)"], aes(x= Date, y = Value,colour = `Income_group`))

```
All good. 
We can now pass to the Shiny app.R !
